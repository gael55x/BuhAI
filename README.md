# BuhAI: Personalized Diabetes Assistant

BuhAI is a comprehensive diabetes management application that combines a modern React Native frontend with a powerful AI-powered backend. The app helps Filipinos, particularly Cebuanos, manage diabetes through personalized, real-time insights using Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) data and user-logged information.

## Key Features

- **24/7 Personal Diabetes Assistant**: AI-powered chat interface for real-time diabetes management
- **Predictive Insights**: Advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for personalized recommendations
- **Bisaya Language Support**: User-friendly interface in conversational Cebuano
- **Real-time Glucose Monitoring**: Integration with CGM data for accurate predictions
- **Smart Alerts**: Proactive warnings for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia events
- **Progress Tracking**: Daily summaries and trend analysis
- **Multi-platform**: Built with Expo for iOS, Android, and web

## Architecture

The app consists of two main components:

### Frontend (React Native/Expo)
- Modern, responsive UI built with React Native
- Real-time chat interface with the AI assistant
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, Web)
- Integrated with backend RAG system

### Backend (Python/Flask)
- **Hybrid RAG System**: Combines retrieved unstructured text with structured data
- **ChromaDB Vector Store**: Fast semantic retrieval of user logs
- **SQLite Database**: Structured storage of user data and health metrics
- **Gemini AI Integration**: Natural language processing for Bisaya responses
- **RESTful API**: Clean API endpoints for frontend integration

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.9+
- Google Gemini API Key
- iOS Simulator (for iOS development) or Android Studio (for Android development)

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your Gemini API key
   echo "EXPO_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

4. **Open the app**
   - Press `i` for iOS simulator
   - Press `a` for Android emulator
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app on your device

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the RAG system**
   ```bash
   cd RAG-SIMPLIFIED
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file in RAG-SIMPLIFIED directory
   echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

5. **Initialize database and vector store**
   ```bash
   python ingest/ingest_csv.py
   ```

6. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## ðŸ“± Usage

### Chat Interface
- Open the app and navigate to the "Chat" tab
- Type questions about diabetes management in English or Bisaya
- Receive personalized insights based on your health data
- Get real-time glucose predictions and recommendations

### Sample Interactions
- "I just ate 2 cups of rice and chicken"
- "What's my glucose trend today?"
- "Should I exercise now?"
- "Unsa ang akong sugar level karon?" (What's my sugar level now?)

## API Endpoints

### Health Status
```bash
GET /api/v1/status
```

### Get Personalized Insight
```bash
POST /api/v1/insight
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "user_id": "demo_user_01",
  "event_type": "meal",
  "event_data": {
    "description": "2 cups of white rice and fried chicken"
  }
}
```

### Check Missed Meals
```bash
GET /api/v1/inactivity-check
```

### Daily Progress Report
```bash
GET /api/v1/daily-summary
```

## Testing

For detailed API testing instructions, see [RAG-SIMPLIFIED/TESTING_README.md](RAG-SIMPLIFIED/TESTING_README.md)

## Development Workflow

1. **Reset to fresh project** (if needed)
   ```bash
   npm run reset-project
   ```

2. **Start both servers**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Frontend
   npx expo start
   
   # Terminal 2: Backend
   cd RAG-SIMPLIFIED && python app.py
   ```

3. **Update IP address**
   - Update the backend API URL in `app/(tabs)/chat.tsx` to match your local IP
   - Default: `http://192.168.20.27:5000/api/v1/insight`
